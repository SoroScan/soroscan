# ✅ First-Time Contributor Setup Checklist

Before starting your first contribution, complete the following checklist:

* [ ] Fork `SoroScan/soroscan` on GitHub.
* [ ] Clone your fork locally.
* [ ] Add the official SoroScan repository as `upstream`.
* [ ] Fetch the latest upstream changes.
* [ ] Check out an up-to-date `dev` branch.
* [ ] Install the dependencies required for the area you are changing.
* [ ] Configure the local backend environment if required.
* [ ] Install frontend dependencies if required.
* [ ] Install the repository pre-commit hooks.
* [ ] Run the relevant tests and lint checks.
* [ ] Create a contribution branch from `dev`.
* [ ] Keep changes limited to the assigned issue.
* [ ] Push your branch to your fork.
* [ ] Open a pull request against `dev`.

---

# 🛠️ Environment Setup

## 1. Prerequisites

Install the tools required for the area of SoroScan you plan to work on.

Core tools include:

* Git
* Python
* Node.js
* pnpm
* Docker
* Docker Compose

Rust and Cargo are also required when contributing to the Soroban contracts.

Check your installed tools:

```bash
git --version
python --version
node --version
pnpm --version
docker --version
docker compose version
```

On systems where Python is available as `python3`, use:

```bash
python3 --version
```

---

## 2. Fork and Clone the Repository

Fork:

```text
https://github.com/SoroScan/soroscan
```

Then clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/soroscan.git
cd soroscan
```

Your fork should be configured as `origin`.

Verify:

```bash
git remote -v
```

---

## 3. Add the Official Repository as `upstream`

Add the main SoroScan repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SoroScan/soroscan.git
git fetch upstream
```

Verify:

```bash
git remote -v
```

A typical setup should contain:

```text
origin    https://github.com/<your-username>/soroscan.git
upstream  https://github.com/SoroScan/soroscan.git
```

If `upstream` already exists, simply run:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

---

## 4. Prepare the `dev` Branch

Contributor branches should be created from the latest `dev` branch.

If `dev` already exists locally:

```bash
git switch dev
git pull --ff-only upstream dev
```

If you do not yet have a local `dev` branch:

```bash
git switch -c dev --track upstream/dev
```

Confirm your branch:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

Expected output:

```text
dev
```

---

## 5. Create a Contribution Branch

Create a descriptive branch from the updated `dev` branch:

```bash
git switch -c <branch-name>
```

Recommended prefixes include:

```text
feat/
fix/
docs/
refactor/
chore/
```

Examples:

```text
feat/add-contract-filter
fix/webhook-retry-status
docs/contributor-onboarding
```

Do not make contribution commits directly on `dev` or `main`.

---

# 🐳 Running the Project with Docker

From the repository root, the quickest way to start the local stack is:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Check running services:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Common local endpoints include:

```text
Backend:  http://localhost:8000
GraphQL:  http://localhost:8000/graphql/
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
```

Stop the stack with:

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

# 🐍 Backend Setup

From the repository root:

```bash
cd django-backend
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it on Linux, macOS, WSL, or Git Bash:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create the environment file if needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Do not commit `.env` files, credentials, API keys, JWTs, webhook secrets, or private keys.

Apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Start the backend:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The GraphQL endpoint is available at:

```text
http://localhost:8000/graphql/
```

---

# ⚛️ Frontend Setup

From the repository root:

```bash
cd soroscan-frontend
pnpm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The frontend normally runs at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Generate GraphQL types:

```bash
pnpm run codegen
```

When generating against a running local backend on Bash, Git Bash, Linux, or macOS:

```bash
GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/graphql/ pnpm run codegen
```

Watch GraphQL files and regenerate automatically:

```bash
pnpm run codegen:watch
```

---

# 🪝 Pre-Commit Hooks

SoroScan provides a repository-level `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

The configured hooks check:

* trailing whitespace;
* end-of-file newlines;
* YAML syntax;
* accidentally added large files;
* Python formatting with Black;
* Python linting with Flake8;
* Python import ordering with isort.

## Install pre-commit

Install the tool:

```bash
python -m pip install pre-commit
```

From the repository root, install the Git hook:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Run all hooks manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

After installation, the configured hooks run automatically when you create a commit.

If a hook modifies a file, review the change, stage it again, and rerun the checks.

Do not routinely bypass pre-commit using `--no-verify`. Fix the reported issue instead.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git switch dev
git pull --ff-only upstream dev
```

Then create your branch:

```bash

## 4. Testing Requirements

| Sub-project                    | Main test command           |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `django-backend`               | `pytest`                    |
| `soroscan-frontend`            | `pnpm test`                 |
| `soroscan-frontend` end-to-end | `pnpm run test:e2e`         |
| `admin`                        | Run relevant package checks |
| `soroban-contracts`            | `cargo test`                |
| `sdk/typescript`               | `pnpm test`                 |
| `sdk/python`                   | `pytest`                    |

# 📤 Pull Request Submission Guidelines

## 1. Update Your Branch Before Submission

Fetch the latest upstream changes:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

Make sure you are on your contribution branch:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

Then rebase on the latest `dev`:

```bash
git rebase upstream/dev
```

If conflicts occur:

1. resolve the conflicting files;
2. stage the resolved files:

```bash
git add <resolved-file>
```

3. continue the rebase:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

---

## 2. Review Your Changes

Before committing or opening the PR:

```bash
git status
git diff
git diff --check
```

Confirm:

* only files required by the issue were changed;
* no credentials or environment files were added;
* required tests or documentation checks pass;
* the acceptance criteria are satisfied.

---

## 3. Push Your Branch

Push to your fork:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

For later updates:

```bash
git push
```

If you rebased a branch that was already pushed, use:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin <branch-name>
```

Use force-with-lease only for your own contribution branch.

---

## 4. Open the Pull Request

Open the PR with:

```text
base: dev
compare: <your-branch>
```

Use a clear Conventional Commit-style title.

Examples:

```text
docs: add contributor onboarding guide
fix(webhooks): handle delivery timeout
feat(graphql): add event filtering
```

---

## 5. Link Issues

Use GitHub closing keywords when the PR fully resolves an issue:

```text
Closes #123
```

If one PR intentionally resolves multiple assigned issues:

```text
Closes #123
Closes #124
Closes #125
```

Only list issues actually resolved by the PR.
